Pros:
  State mutation (kind of)
  Single file components

Cons:
  Poor TS support
  Even worse CSS support
  Complex library management
  Lack of user autocomplete (importing components)
  Need to explicitly declare types twice in order for them to be available on the <template>
  Hard to troubleshoot, having 3 different ways to do things (options, class, composition) makes it very hard to search for errors
